Lossy compression of data is a 
potentially intriguing solution but could 
also easily be ``scary'' to scientists.
In this paper, we

2 bits per value. Under certain constraints, 
we show that low precision IHT is going to 
converge with guarantees on the recovery quality.
The second contribution is a tailored

\begin{abstract} 


Modern scientific instruments produce vast amounts of data, 
which can overwhelm the processing ability of computer systems. 
Lossy compression of data can be an intriguing solution, 
but comes with its own dangers, such as potential signal loss, or need for careful parameter optimization. 
In this work, we focus on a specific instance of this problem, 
in the case of compressive sensing frameworks for radio astronomy, 
and ask: 
{\em Can the precision of data representation be lowered for \underline{all} 
input data, with recovery guarantees and good practical performance?}

Our first contribution is a
theoretical analysis of the Iterative Hard 
Thresholding (IHT) algorithm when all input
data, that is, the measurement matrix and the
observation, are quantized aggressively, to as little as 
2 bits per value. 
Under reasonable constraints, 
we show that low precision IHT can still provide recovery guarantees. 
The second contribution is a tailored 
analysis of our general quantized framework  
to radio astronomy, showing that its conditions are satisfied in this case. 
We evaluate our approach 
using an FPGA implementation, and show that
it can achieve up to 9.14$\times$ speed up with
negligible loss of recovery quality, on  real telescope data.

%We then illustrate through empirical experiments 
%the potential for radio interferometry imaging with 
%achievement of 7.7x speed up on Field-Programmable 
%Gate Array. An application to LOFAR, the low 
%frequency array in Netherlands, leads to a better 
%resolution of the sky sources recovered with order 
%of magnitude speed up. 

%offers near optimal recovery of compressible signals sampled below the Nyquist rate. IHT, however, seems to have a computational bottleneck when applied to the compressed sensing recovery problems with general (non-Gaussian) dense measurement matrices. To relieve this, we propose to compress the measurement matrix by quantizing the bit-widths of its entries at each iteration. 

%This low precision framework results in runtime efficiency on hardware yet still maintaining the stability and performance guarantees of the algorithm. To demonstrate this, we first derive theoretical error bounds for sparse signal recovery. Under certain constraints, low precision IHT is shown to converge with performance guarantees. We then illustrate through empirical experiments the potential for radio interferometry imaging with achievement of 7.7x speed up on Field-Programmable Gate Array. An application to LOFAR, the low frequency array in Netherlands, leads to a better resolution of the sky sources recovered with order of magnitude speed up.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-.5em}

%\vspace{-1em}
The ability to collect, store, and process large amount of
data is enabling a next generation of {\em data intensive} scientific 
instruments. For example,
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the largest
radio telescope ever built, has thousands of 
dishes, and is expected to achieve
raw data throughput of 62 exabytes by mid-2020.
Such instruments require advanced  
capabilities in terms of engineering, algorithms, calibration, and storage~\cite{hu, rik2016ska}. 

%. The most powerful radio telescope on Earth that has ever known, the SKA combines thousands of antennas at various locations spread over an extensive area on the ground. The data collected by the antennas is immense to be efficiently processed further in the operational chain. The estimated raw data throughput by mid 2020s is 62 exabytes: 20 times higher than the global email traffic. The SKA thus demands advanced functional and operational capabilities such as engineering, algorithms, instrument calibration, storage and many others~\cite{hu, rik2016ska}.

  on both theory and system.}

\end{figure}

\vspace{-1em}
In this paper, we focus on compressive sensing~\cite{donoho2006cs, candes2006cs, candes2006cs2}, one popular mathematical formulation behind many of these instruments. Particularly, we are interested in understanding
the impact of {\em representing all input data
in lower precision, instead of 32-bit floating points}. 
We make the following technical contributions:

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We develop a theoretical framework, which shows for the first time that, under certain
technical conditions, Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT),
one popular algorithm for compressive sensing, is converges
with guarantees on the recovery quality using only 
input data in lower precision.
\item We refine our results in the context of a radio
astronomy application which can be easily formulated in
the context of compressive sensing, 
and develop {stronger} application-specific 
guarantees for sky recovery using the properties of the measurement matrix in this application. 
\item We evaluate our approach on an FPGA-based
implementation that achieves up to 9.14$\times$ speed up 
on problems with a dense measurement matrix quantized to 2-bit precision, and with 8-bit observations.
We believe this approach can further generalize to other sparse reconstruction problems demanding high processing capability. 
\end{enumerate}



%This work proposes to reduce the precision of floating-point data representations by reducing the bit widths, hence enabling more information transfer and processed at the Central Signal Processor of telescope. We first linearize image acquisition process by formulating the problem in compressive sensing framework, and under certain constraints, derive near-optimal guarantees for precise sky recovery. Our approach is a general framework and can facilitate further sparse reconstruction problems demanding high processing capability in practice. We demonstrate the power of our proposal on LOFAR, where we achieve significant practical speedup.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Problem Formulation}

\vspace{-0.5em}
Compressive sensing (CS)~\cite{donoho2006cs, candes2006cs, candes2006cs2} is a foundational technique in sparse signal reconstruction. CS offers a range of efficient algorithms acquiring high dimensional signals from inaccurate and incomplete samples with an underlying sparse structure. 
Many real-life problems, e.g, medical imaging, interferometry, video, spectroscopy and genomic data analysis, can benefit from these techniques.

% 1- CS
In mathematical terms, the standard CS problem is formulated as follows. Let a sparse or approximately sparse signal ${\bf x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ be sampled via a linear sampling operator ${\bf \Phi}^{M\times N}$. In matrix notation, the vector of measurements ${\bf y} \in \mathbb{C}^M$ is
\begin{equation}\label{CS_model}
 {\bf y} =  {\bf \Phi}  {\bf x} + {\bf e}
\end{equation}
where ${\bf e}$ is the observation noise and $M < N$.

CS recovery algorithms iteratively build up a sparse estimate ${\bf x}$ such that ${\bf \Phi}  {\bf x}$ approximates ${\bf y}$ well, that is,  $\| {\bf y}- {\bf \Phi}  {\bf x} \|_2$ is small. The sparsity constraint imposed on ${\bf x}$ overcomes this ill-posed problem, yet is computationally NP-hard due to its combinatorial nature. 
Therefore, most CS algorithms resort to convex relaxation of $\ell_0$-based optimization, or a collection of thresholding and greedy methods such as Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) \cite{blumensath2008iht, blumensath2009iht} and Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) \cite{needel2008cosamp}. The past decade has seen significant work on such methods, see~\cite{liu2017dualiht, yuan2014ht, yuan2016htp, blumensath2013cs, needel2008cosamp} and references therein. These references present an almost-comprehensive analysis of the provable performance guarantees for such sparsity-constrained minimization methods, in terms of convergence to fixed points of $\ell_0$-regularized cost functions and the optimality of such approximations. However, these frameworks face several challenges when applied to real-life problems: for provable guarantees, it is often required that (1) the measurement matrix ${\bf \Phi}$ satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)~\cite{candes2008rip, chartrand2008rip}, and that (2) the sparsity level is chosen appropriately. 
Normalized IHT (NIHT)~ \cite{blumensath2010niht}, is a simple yet very effective strategy  which relieves some of the limitations listed above: a step size parameter is introduced to the traditional IHT~\cite{blumensath2008iht}. This simple refinement alleviates the RIP condition imposed on ${\bf \Phi}$, enabling rigorous guarantees for a broader class of practical problems. {This paper
builds upon the work of Blumensath and Davies.}

\vspace{-1em}
\paragraph*{Problem Formulation}
 We consider the sparse signal recovery problem in (\ref{CS_model}) described as: given ${\bf y}$ and ${\bf \Phi}$, find coefficients ${\bf x}$ minimizing the cost function
 \begin{equation}\label{cost_function}
     \|{\bf y} - {\bf \Phi x} \|_2^2 \ \ \rm{subject \ to \ \|{\bf x} \|_0 \leq s},
 \end{equation}
 where $\|{\bf x} \|_0 = |\rm{supp}({\bf x})| = |\{i: x_i\neq 0 \}|$.
 

%\subsection{Technical contributions}

Under certain constraints, normalized IHT is guaranteed to approximate ${\bf x}$ with high accuracy. Here, we consider the properties of this algorithm in a lossy compression setting, where the data ${\bf y}$ and ${\bf \Phi}$ consisting of floating point values undergoes a stochastic rounding process to a small set of integer levels denoted by $Q$, to reduce the high cost of data transmission. That is, we wish to recover ${\bf x}$ using the following modified NIHT update rule:
 \begin{equation}
     {\bf x}^{[n+1]} = H_s({\bf x}^{[n]} + \mu^{[n]}Q({\bf \Phi})(Q({\bf y}) - Q({\bf \Phi}){\bf x}^{[n]}))
 \end{equation}
where $H_s({\bf x}): \mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n$ the nonlinear operator that preserves the largest $s$ (in magnitude) entries of {\bf x} and sets the remaining to zero. 
 
 % The core contribution of this work is two fold in theory and algorithm as highlighted in below: 
 %
 %    $\bullet$ Low precision IHT: we established a rigorous analysis on the quality of recovery by bounding the approximation error. To our knowledge, compression performed on the measurement matrix has not been reported elsewhere in liteature.\\
 %    $\bullet$ We formulate radio interferometry imaging as a CS problem and employed low precision IHT on a real telescope. Our experiments demonstrated that sky map can still be recovered with no or small accuracy lost by using only 2-bits to represent the data points with 7.7x speed-up on FPGA.
     
%{\bf Organization. }
%The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{section_related_work} we briefly review some relevant work. Section \ref{section_iht} serves an introduction to IHT, including the theoretical performance guarantees. Section~\ref{section_lpiht} describes how the low precision framework is applied to IHT and presents derivable theoretical guarantees for such a lossy scheme, and devises our approach for real telescopes. Section~\ref{section_experiments} reports the numerical evaluation results. Section~\ref{section_discussion} concludes the overview.

\section{Related work}\label{section_related_work}
\vspace{-0.5em}

Using low precision data representation for compressive sensing
is not new. In fact, a wave of studies made successive attempts to apply low precision  
to compressive sensing problems, summarized in
Fig.~\ref{tab:cs}. \cite{boufounos20091bitcs} demonstrate the sparse signals can be recovered with a scale factor when measurements preserve only sign information. \cite{ai20121bitcs, davenport20121bit} exhibit that approximately sparse signals can be robustly recovered from single-bit measurements sampled with a sub-gaussian distribution. \cite{jacques20111bit, laska20111bitcs} study the similar setting with a Gaussian measurement matrix the so called Binary IHT. \cite{plan20111bitcs, plan20121bitcs} propose a computationally tractable and optimal recovery of 1-bit compressive sensing problem. \cite{recht20121bitcs, gopi20131bitcs} present provable theoretical guarantees to identify support recovery of high dimensional sparse signals for 1-bit measurements. 

{This paper is different from these references
in two ways: first, as we discuss in Section~\ref{section_lpiht},
our assumption that the measurement matrix being
non-symmetric RIP is critical in our radio astronomy applications, 
and none of these assumptions made by previous work would fit  this use case; second, we are the only work,
with the exceptionof~\cite{gopi20131bitcs}, that quantizes
{\em both} the measurement matrix $\Phi$ and the observations.
We discuss the system-side benefits  
of quantizing the matrix $\Phi$ in Section~\ref{sec:fpga}.
} 

%\cite{recht20121bitcs} identifies the support of sparse signals by using binary measurements.

%\cite{gopi20131bitcs} studies 1 bit CS with rigorous support and approximation error: norm(x-xs) guarantee. The measurement matrix is designed using a Gaussian and the actual measurement matrix}

Another emerging line of work has been on low precision training for 
machine learning applications beyond compressive
sensing. Examples include Buckwild!~\cite{desa2015hogwild},
QSGD~\cite{alistarh2016qsgd},  
ZipML~\cite{zhang2017zipml}, and
a series of works about 
partial or end-to-end low-precision training 
of deep learning models~\cite{seide2014sgd1bit, hubara2016qsnn, rastegari2016binarycnn,zhou2016cnn, miyashita2016cnn, li2016twn, gupta2015dl}.
Most of these work are built upon stochastic gradient descent. In this paper, we 
go beyond SGD and focus on  compressive sensing.


%Multi-level quantization of measurement for CS problems, therefore, exhibit a great empirical success. The analysis of such heuristics is yet challenging. In this paper, a successive application of low precision framework to CS, particularly IHT, is shown to possess rigorous theoretical guaratees, potentially allowing more efficient information processing in large scale applications. To distinct from the prior proposals listed above, we achieve this by quantizing not only measurements but also measurement matrix.

Another line of research on 
designing efficient algorithms for sparse recovery problems~\cite{blumensath2011aiht, wei2015fiht, blanchard2013iht, cevher2011ht, liu2017dualiht}. In this paper, we focus on the normalized IHT algorithm, and leave extensions to other recovery methods as future work.




\vspace{-1em}
\section{Preliminaries}\label{section_iht}
\vspace{-0.5em}

In this section, we review the preliminary results on the normalized IHT (NIHT) algorithm introduced by~\cite{blumensath2010niht, blumensath2012greedy}.
\vspace{-0.3em}

{\it Notation:} Scalars are denoted by italics, vectors by bold lower-case and matrices by bold upper-case. For all ${\bf x}= (x_1, \hdot, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we denote by $\|{\bf x}\|_p$ the standard operator norm. Let ${\bf \Phi}_{m, n}\in \mathbb{C}^{M\times N}$ denote its element in the $m$'th row and $n$'th column. Finally $b_{\bf \Phi}/b_{\bf y}${\it-bit precision} implies that number of bits used to represent vector of observations ${\bf y}$ and the measurement matrix ${\bf \Phi}$ are $b_{\bf \Phi}$ and $b_{\bf y}$, respectively.
\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Iterative Hard Thresholding} 
\vspace{-0.5em}
Let ${\bf x}^{[0]} = 0$. Normalized IHT has the following update rule per iteration
\begin{equation}\label{iht_update_rule}
{\bf x}^{[n+1]} = H_s({\bf x}^{[n]} + \mu^{[n]}{\bf \Phi}({\bf y}-{\bf \Phi}{\bf x}^{[n]})),
\end{equation}
where $\mu^{[n]}>0$ is the adaptive step size parameter, and $H_s({\bf x})$ is the
thresholding operator that preserves the largest $s$ (in magnitude) entries.



%Under certain conditions, the normalized IHT converges to a local minimum of the optimization problem
%\begin{equation}\label{cost_function}
%    \textrm{min} \|{\bf y}-{\bf \Phi x} \|_2^2
%\ \ \ {\textrm{subject \ to }}\ \ \|{\bf x}\|_0 \leq s.
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Convergence} 
The analysis of hard thresholding algorithms heavily relies on the scaling properties of ${\bf \Phi}$. More precisely, the convergence to a local minimum of the cost function Eqn.~\ref{cost_function} as well as the quality of such approximation are proven under certain conditions on ${\bf \Phi}$. More concretely, one must often deal with non-symmetric Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition: a matrix ${\bf \Phi}$ satisfies non-symmetric RIP if
\begin{equation}\label{rip}
\alpha_{s} \leq \frac{\|{\bf \Phi} {\bf x}\|_2}{\|{\bf x}\|_2} \leq \beta_{s}
\end{equation}
for all ${\bf x}: \|{\bf x}\|_0 \leq s$, and where $\alpha_s, \beta_s \in \mathbb{R}, \ \alpha_s\leq \beta_s$, the so-called Restricted Isometric Constants (RICs), are lower and upper singular values of ${\bf \Phi}$, respectively.

\begin{remark}\label{remark_noise_amp}
The convergence of normalized IHT depends conditionally on the step size parameter $\mu^{[n]}$, unlike the traditional IHT approach where $\mu^{[n]}=1$.
While the traditional approach requires a re-scaling of the measurement matrix such that $\|{\bf \Phi}\|_2 <1$ to ensure convergence, introducing a step size parameter enables the arbitrary scaling of ${\bf \Phi}$ hence relaxing the bounds on its norm. The role of $\mu^{[n]}$ here is to compensate for this re-scaling by accordingly avoiding undesirable amplification of noise, i.e., the ratio of $\|{\bf \Phi x}\|_2/\|{\bf e}\|_2$ remains unchanged. 
\end{remark}

The main convergence result can be stated as follows.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem_convergence_IHT}
{\rm{\cite{blumensath2012greedy}}}\\ 
Let ${\bf \Phi}$ be full rank, and $s\leq m$. If $\beta_{2s}\leq\mu^{-1}$, then NIHT converges to a local minimum of Eqn.~\ref{cost_function}.
\end{theorem}
\subsection{Step Size Determination} 
While setting the step size parameter, the condition that $\beta_{2s}\leq\mu^{-1}$ ensuring convergence poses the following challenge. To date, there is no universal strategy known to check if the RIP holds for an arbitrary measurement matrix in a computationally efficient manner. A similar discussion holds for attaining the RICs, i.e., ${\beta_s}$ and $\alpha_s$, associated with the measurement matrix ${\bf \Phi}$. It can however be shown that, under certain conditions, randomly constructed measurement matrices can satisfy
the RIP with high probability~\cite{candes2008rip, chartrand2008rip}. Still, this remains a bottleneck for a more general class of
measurement matrices. Without losing the main track, here we intend to review a more generic strategy for step size determination. 

If the support is fixed, a natural strategy to set the step size adaptively is~\cite{blumensath2010niht}
\begin{equation}\label{step_size}
   \mu^{[n]} = \frac{{\bf g}^T_{\Gamma^{[n]}}{\bf g}_{\Gamma^{[n]}}}{{\bf g}^T_{\Gamma^{[n]}}{\bf \Phi}^T_{\Gamma^{[n]}}{\bf \Phi}_{\Gamma^{[n]}}{\bf g}_{\Gamma^{[n]}}}
\end{equation}
where ${\bf g}^{[n]} = {\bf \Phi}^T({\bf y}-{\bf \Phi x}^{[n]})$. Clearly, the maximal reduction in cost function can then be attained. However, if the support of ${\bf x}^{[n+1]}$ differs from that of ${\bf x}^{[n]}$, the sufficient convergence condition  becomes
\begin{equation}
    \mu^{[n]} \leq(1-c) \frac{\|{\bf x}^{[n+1]}-{\bf x}^{[n]} \|_2^2}{\|{\bf \Phi}({\bf x}^{[n+1]}-{\bf x}^{[n]}) \|_2^2},
\end{equation}
for any small constant $c$.

If the above condition is not met, a new proposal for ${\bf x}^{[n+1]}$ can be calculated by using $\mu^{[n]}\leftarrow{\mu^{[n]}/(k(1-c))}$, where $k$ is a shrinkage parameter such that $k>1/(1-c)$.
% In a series of papers [...], extensive research effors have been made and strong theoretical guarantees were derived. Here we state the most refined recovery error bounds.
This adaptive setting of step size parameter is shown to provide RIP-invariant convergence  as follows.
\begin{theorem}\label{guarantee_niht}
{\rm{\cite{blumensath2010niht}}}\\
Consider a noisy observation ${\bf y} = {\bf \Phi x} + {\bf e}$ with an arbitrary vector {\bf x}. If rank({${\bf \Phi}$}) = m and rank(${\bf \Phi}$_{\Gamma}) = s \ $\forall \Gamma:\ |\Gamma| = s$, then the normalized IHT algorithm converges to a local minimum of the cost function Eqn.~\ref{cost_function}. Also, assume ${\bf \Phi}}$ is non-symmetric RIP$_{2s}$ and let $\gamma_{2s} = \beta_{2s}/\alpha_{2s}-1$. If $\gamma_{2s} \leq {1}/{8}$, then
\begin{equation}
    \| {\bf x}-{\bf x}^n\|_2 \leq 2^{-n}\| {\bf x}^s\|_2 + 8 {{\bf \epsilon}_s}\label{niht_error_bound}
\end{equation} where \begin{equation}
     {{\bf \epsilon}_s} =  \| {\bf x}-{\bf x}^s\|_2 + \frac{\| {\bf x}-{\bf x}^s\|_1}{\sqrt{s}}+\frac{1}{\beta_{2s}}\|{\bf e} \|_2.
\end{equation}
After at most $n^*=\log_2(\|{\bf x}^s\|_2/ {\bf \epsilon}_s)$ iterations, the recovery error bound in Eqn.~\ref{niht_error_bound} can be further simplified to
\begin{equation}
   \| {\bf x}-{\bf x}^n\|_2 \leq 9 {{\bf \epsilon}_s}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
The above result suggests that, after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the reconstruction error is induced only by the noise ${\bf e}$ and that ${\bf x}$ is not exactly s-sparse.

\vspace{-1em}
\section{Low Precision Iterative Thresholding}\label{section_lpiht}
\vspace{-0.5em}

In this section, we analyze the
quantized version of IHT for 
its guarantee for signal recovery performance.
The key development here is that, by reducing the bit widths of the data points in a structured manner, we
can upper bound the recovery error. 
In Section~\ref{section_experiments},
we will show that for radio astronomy,
we expect this error to be small, given
the structure of the measurement matrix.

As introduced earlier, let ${\bf x}^{[0]} = 0$ and use iteration
\begin{equation} \label{modified_update_rule}
  {\bf x}^{[n+1]} = H_s\big({\bf x}^{[n]}+\hat{\mu}^{[n]} Q_b(\boldsymbol{\Phi})(Q_b({\bf y})-Q_b(\boldsymbol{\Phi}){\bf x}^{[n]})\big)  
\end{equation}
where $Q(\cdot)$ is the quantization function that maps single-precision floating-points onto a co-domain where each element has $b$-bits precision.

{\bf Quantization Scheme:} We analyze a stochastic quantization function denoted with $Q_b({\bf v})$, where ${\bf v}=(v_1, v_2, .., v_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is an arbitrary vector and $b$ is the total number of bits used to represent it. {\bf v} can then be quantized into $l=2^b$ levels as follows. Let $\ell_i$, $i\in \{1, 2, ..., l-1 \}$ denote $l$ equally spaced points on $[-1, 1]$ such that $\ell_1= -1$, $\ell_l= +1$ and $\ell_1\leq\ell_2 \leq ... \leq \ell_l$, also $v_j$ for $j\in \{1, 2, ..., d \}$ fall into the interval $[\ell_i, \ell_{i+1}]$. Then we assign the probabilities to the nearest levels as
\[
    Q_b(v_j) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        \ell_i, & \textrm{with probability} \ \frac{\ell_{i+1}-v_j}{\ell_{i+1}-\ell_i}\\
        \ell_{i+1},&\textrm{otherwise}.  \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
        \end{array}
\]
  
Remark that the above equation yields that the quantization operation $Q(\cdot)$ is unbiased, i.e., $\mathbb{E}[Q_b({\bf v})] = {\bf v}$. Also, let $\hat{{\bf v}}$ represent the quantized ${\bf v}$ and drop $Q_b(\cdot)$ to simplify notational burden. The detailed steps of the algorithm is then given in Algorithm \ref{low_precision_iht}.

{\bf Deterministic Quantization:} A slightly more efficient compression scheme is via deterministic quantization, i.e., quantize the number
$v_j \in [\ell_i, \ell_{i+1}]$ directly to the nearest
value, either $\ell_i$ or $\ell_{i+1}$. 
This quantization scheme will lead to the same 
error bound and similar empirical result as stochastic quantization. {We leave the analysis
of this case to the supplementary material.}

   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL $n = n^*$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

{\bf Convergence:} The modified algorithm attains a local minimum of the cost function $\mathbb{E} [ \| \hat{\bf y} - \hat{\bf \Phi}{\bf x}\|_2^2]$ such that $\|{\bf x}\|_0 \leq s$. This can be majorized by the following surrogate objective function 
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \mathbb{E} [\|\mu^{0.5}\hat{\bf y} -   \hat{\bf \Phi}{\bf x}\|_2^2+ \|{\bf x} 
    - {\bf x}^{[n]} \|_2^2
    - \|\mu^{0.5}\hat{\bf \Phi}({\bf x}- {\bf x}^{[n]}) \|_2^2] 
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
whenever $\| \mu^{0.5}\hat{\bf \Phi}\|_2^2 <1$. If this condition is met, the minimizer of the above surrogate objective: ${\bf x}^{[n+1]}$ ensures that $\mathbb{E} [\| \hat{\bf y} - \hat{\bf \Phi}{\bf x}^{[n+1]}\|_2^2] \leq \mathbb{E}[ \| \hat{\bf y} - \hat{\bf \Phi}{\bf x}^{[n]}\|_2^2]$. Moreover, by using the arguments of~\cite{blumensath2008iht}, Eqn.~\ref{modified_update_rule} can be shown to minimize the expected cost $\mathbb{E} [ \| \hat{\bf y} - \hat{\bf \Phi}{\bf x}\|_2^2]$. For deterministic quantization scheme, Theorem~\ref{theorem_convergence_IHT} ensures the convergence to a fixed point. {We
will focus on the analysis of performance guarantee
instead of convergence.}

%{\bf Computational Complexity:} The iterative thresholding algorithm involves two vector additions and two dense matrix multiplication as well as a thresholding operation per iteration, and this is doubled due to step size search. Low precision approach however reduces memory requirements significantly. (we need to improve here)
 
{\bf Conditions on ${\Phi}$:} The restricted isometry property holds for the quantized measurement if
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\alpha}_{s} \leq \frac{\|\hat{{\bf \Phi}} {\bf x}\|_2}{\|{\bf x}\|_2} \leq \hat{\beta}_{s}
\end{equation}
$\forall {\bf x}: \| {\bf x}\|_0 \leq s$. Furthermore, the RICs: $\hat{\alpha}_s$ and $\hat{\beta}_s$ can be re-scaled accordingly with $\hat{\bf \Phi}$.

%{\bf Bounds of $\$:} 
%The step size $\hat{\mu}^{[n]}$ is required to counteract the scaling of $\hat{{\bf \Phi}}$ such that $\|\hat{\mu}^{0.5} \hat{\bf\Phi}\|_2^2 <1$ to ensure the convergence. 
%This adaptive step size setting yields the trivial bound on $\mu$ as~\cite{blumensath2012greedy}
%\begin{equation}
 %  1/\hat{\beta}_{2s}^2\leq  1/\hat{\beta}_s^2 < \hat{\mu}^{[n]} < 1/\hat{\alpha}_s^2 \leq 1/\hat{\alpha}_{2s}^2.
%\end{equation}
%Moreover, using \ref{step_size} in the low precision setting, we can initially determine $\hat{\mu}^{[n]}$ to guarantee the convergence without requiring the knowledge of the restricted isometry constants.

\subsection{Performance Guarantees}
\vspace{-0.5em}
The recovery performance of such algorithms is of our primary interest. The following theorem states the recovery error by explicitly exhibiting the component introduced by the quantization.

\begin{theorem}\label{main_theorem_TH}
Given a noisy observation ${\bf y} = {\bf \Phi x}+{\bf e} $ where ${\bf y} \in \mathbb{C}^M$, ${\bf \Phi} \in \mathbb{C}^{M\times N}$ and ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is an arbitrary vector with $\|{\bf x} \|_0 \leq s$. Let $H_s({\bf x}) = {\bf x}^s$ with $s\leq m$, ${\bf \Phi}$ and $\hat{\bf \Phi}$ satisfy the non-symmetric RIP with ${\alpha}_s, {\beta}_s$ and $\hat{\alpha}_s, \hat{\beta}_s$ where ${\gamma}_{2s} = {\beta}_{2s}/{\alpha}_{2s} -1 \leq 1/16$ and $\hat{\gamma}_{2s} = \hat{\beta}_{2s}/\hat{\alpha}_{2s} -1 \leq 1/16$, respectively. If the normalized IHT algorithm is used at low precision we have
\begin{equation}\label{main_theorem}
\begin{split}
        \mathbb{E}[\|\hat{{\bf x}}^{[n+1]}-{\bf x}^s\|_2]  
        \leq &2^{-n}\|{\bf x}^{s}\|_2  + 10 {\epsilon}_s + 5 {\epsilon}_q
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
 {\epsilon}_s = \frac{1}{\beta_{2s}}\|{\bf e} \|_2 +\bigg  [ \|{\bf x}-{\bf x}^s \|_2 + \frac{\|{\bf x}-{\bf x}^s \|_1}{\sqrt{s}}\bigg]    
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 {\epsilon}_q = \frac{\sqrt{M}}{\hat{\beta}_{2s}}\Big ( \frac{\| {\bf x}^s\|_2}{2^{b_{\bf \Phi}-1}}+\frac{1}{2^{b_{\bf y}-1}} \Big )
\end{equation}
where $b_{\bf \Phi}$ and $b_{\bf y}$ are the numbers of bits to represent ${\bf \Phi}$ and ${\bf y}$, respectively.
\end{theorem}

A natural stopping criterion is $n^* = \lceil \log_2 (\|{\bf x}^s \|_2/\epsilon_s)\rceil$ where the algorithm compute a successive approximation to ${\bf x}^s$ with accuracy
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[\|{\bf x}^{[n^*]}-{\bf x}^s \|_2] \leq 11\epsilon_s + 5\epsilon_q.
\end{equation}
The error bound above is actually oversimplified, our proof in the supplementary material is slightly more delicate. Namely, the quantization operator introduces only $\frac{5}{\beta
{2s}} \|{\bf e} \|_2$ into $8 {\epsilon}_s$ in Eqn.~\ref{niht_error_bound}, which is tighter than $10 {\epsilon}_s$ in Eqn.~\ref{main_theorem}.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Discussion and Limitations}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We now examine the error bound presented in Theorem~\ref{main_theorem_TH}. The low precision IHT will asymptotically provide a sparse approximation of ${\bf x}$ up to the multiples of $ {\epsilon}_s$ and $ {\epsilon}_q$ involving the noise term ${\bf e}$, the approximation error on how well ${\bf x}$ can be represented by a sparse vector ${\bf x}^s$ and the corruption introduced by the quantization operator. This makes intuitive sense yet still requires the understanding of our limits on the accuracy of results achievable at low precision. Here we highlight the main limitations.

{\bf Condition on $\hat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}_{2s}$:} In comparison to the unmodified algorithm, the condition under which the performance guarantee holds is stricter in our approach, i.e., ${\gamma}_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/16$ where it was ${\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/8$ in Theorem \ref{guarantee_niht}. In practice, this can be altered with a suitable transformation of $\hat{\bf \Phi}$ such that ${\gamma}_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/16$ is satisfied. Alternatively, a closer look into the derivation in the supplementary material reveals that there exist finite constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $\mathbb{E}[\|{\bf x}^{n^*}-{\bf x}^s \|_2] \leq c_1\epsilon_s + c_2\epsilon_q$ when ${\gamma}_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/8$. For a wide class of problems, an accurate approximation to ${\bf x}^s$ can still be recovered after sufficient number of iterations.
%One might argue that it can potentially amplify noise yet from changing $\gamma_{2s}$ from $1/8$ to $1/16$ 

%We also monitor $\hat{\gamma}_{2s}$ by using the strategy described in ref.
%can easily be verified in a computationally efficient manner
{\bf Natural limitations on ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{2s}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{2s}$:} In both low and high precision settings, the measurement matrix ${\bf \Phi}$ is scale-invariant and rigorous theoretical guarantee is achievable provided its scaling onto sparse vectors is confined in certain intervals, i.e., ${\gamma}_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s}\in [0, 1/16]$. As introduced in Remark \ref{remark_noise_amp}, even this condition is met, there still remains a further limitation by the noise: ${\bf e}$. That is, the signal-to-noise ratio of $\|\hat{\bf \Phi} {\bf x} \|_2/\|{\bf e} \|_2$ will be amplified upon a down-scaling of $\hat{\bf \Phi}$. Re-scaling ${\bf y}$ could accordingly overcome this up to some level. 
{We discuss re-scaling strategies in the supplementary material.}


{\bf Further limitation on ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{2s}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{2s}$ due to quantization:} The recovery error bound satisfying Eqn.~\ref{main_theorem} depends on the error term of high precision IHT: $ {\epsilon_s}$ and the quantization error: $ {\epsilon}_q$ that is inversely proportional to $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$. For a sufficiently large $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$, which compensates for $\sqrt{M} \|{\bf x}^s \|_2$, the low precision approach appears competitive with the unmodified algorithm where the recovery error is bounded by $9\epsilon_s$ in Eqn.~\ref{niht_error_bound}. Furthermore, the scaling-invariant property of the measurement matrix $\hat{\bf \Phi}$ permits us to scale up $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$ by still retaining the strong recovery result similar to that of high precision algorithm. An arbitrary scaling of $\hat{\bf \Phi}$ has no effect on the condition $\hat{\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/16$. We however have strong theoretical guarantees recovery if the low precision algorithm operates in a regime where both ${\gamma}_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/16$ hold and ${\epsilon}_q$ is small.

From the  point of view of quantization, re-scaling ${\bf y}$ and $\hat{\bf \Phi}$ is not necessary. A small   ${\epsilon}_q$ factor naturally reduces the quantization error, yet imposes some mild conditions on $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$. Namely, $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$ can not be arbitrary: instead, it is required to satisfy that all entries of ${\bf y}$ and $\hat{\bf \Phi}$ are contained in $[-1, 1]$.

% \subsection{An Alternative Approach}
% The normalized IHT offers an adaptive step size tuning to ensure maximal reduction in the cost function at each iteration, yet doubling the computational cost. We instead propose using a constant step size that guarantees the convergence, that is, $\hat{\mu}=\frac{k}{\|{\bf \Phi} \|_{\mathcal{F}}}$ with $0<k<1$. This modification might increase the convergence time but counteracts the additional cost introduced by iterative tuning of ${\mu}^{[n]}$. We therefore have the following version.
% \begin{theorem}
% Let ${\bf \Phi}$ satisfies the non-symmetric RIP with RICS $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$. If normalized IHT uses a constant step size $\mu = 1/(8\beta_{2s})$ then
% \begin{equation}\label{secondary_theorem}
% \begin{split}
%         \mathbb{E}[\|\hat{{\bf x}}^{[n+1]}-{\bf x}^s\|_2]  
%         \leq &2^{-n}\|{\bf x}^{s}\|_2  + 10 {\epsilon}_s + 5 {\epsilon}_q
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% with 
% \begin{equation}
%  {\epsilon}_s = \frac{1}{\beta_{2s}}\|{\bf e} \|_2 +\bigg  [ \|{\bf x}-{\bf x}^s \|_2 + \frac{\|{\bf x}-{\bf x}^s \|_1}{\sqrt{s}}\bigg]    
% \end{equation}
% and
% \begin{equation}
%  {\epsilon}_q = \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\hat{\beta}_{2s}}\Big ( \frac{\| {\bf x}^s\|_2}{2^{b_{\bf \Phi}-1}}+\frac{1}{2^{b_{\bf y}-1}} \Big )
% \end{equation}
% \end{theorem}

{\bf Comparison to other state-of-art methods:} The compressive sensing literature covers a range algorithms such as $\ell_1$-minimization, greedy and thresholding-based methods, each with its own trade-offs. In~\cite{blumensath2010niht}, CoSaMP, normalized IHT and $\ell_1$-minimization exhibit similar empirical performance when applied to the problems with dense Gaussian matrices. Moreover, after a simple modification of step size parameter, IHT has became compatible with these powerful methods with similar provable guarantees~\cite{blumensath2012greedy}. 
In the supplementary material, we show the  
empirical performance of low precision IHT on such synthetic examples using  Gaussian measurement matrices.



\vspace{-0.5em}
\subsection{Radio Astronomy Application}
\vspace{-0.5em}

In our application, radio interferometers at various locations on the ground record radio waves emitted by the celestial sources over a certain time interval, then store and process these signals to deduce a sky image. Interferometers first estimate the cross-correlation between the time series measurements, called visibilities, and the sky image is estimated by the so-called {CLEAN} algorithm~\cite{hogbom1974clean}. {CLEAN} is a greedy pursuit technique, deconvolving the inverse Fourier transform of visibilities and forming a sky map by iteratively removing a fraction of the highest peak, convolved with an instrument based point spread function. CLEAN is a simple and easy-to-implement imaging technique, yet radio interferometers are formed as a CS problem, for example, by~\cite{wiaux2009csforra, wenger2010csforra, li2011deconvolution} inspired by its recovery success in noisy environments.

Assume the sky is observed by employing $L$ antennas over a stationary time interval (STI) where the earth rotation is negligible. Denote the vectorized sky image by ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ with $N = {r^2}$ where $r$ is the resolution of images, i.e., height and width of the image in pixels. We formulate the interferometer pipeline as a compressive sensing problem such that ${\bf y} = {\bf \Phi} {\bf x} + {\bf e}$ where ${\bf \Phi} \in \mathbb{C}^{M\times N}$ is the measurement matrix with complex entries as a function of inner product between antenna and pixel locations, ${\bf y} \in \mathbb{C}^{M}$ is the visibilities where $M=L^2$, and ${\bf e} \in \mathbb{C}^M$ is the noise vector. The reader is referred to the supplementary material for detailed derivations. 


{\bf Why iterative hard thresholding?} According to our formulation, the measurement vector ${\bf y}$ represents the cross-correlations between the antenna measurements: the visibilities. The naive method to map from ${\bf y}$ to a vectorized sky image ${\bf x}$ is the Fourier inversion followed by the {CLEAN} algorithm. Alternatively, {A(W)-projection} algorithm initially makes corrections on the visibilities then deduces a sky image~\cite{bhatganar2008raar2008ra}. Still, forming a sky map using the non-uniform samples of visibility functions recorded by finite number of antennas is naturally inaccurate. Furthermore, the thermal noise introduced by the electronic instruments embedded in the RF antenna receivers heavily corrupt the weak incoming signal, and therefore pose a further challenge for these imaging algorithms. To date, the current techniques revolve around carrying out noise reduction by collecting lots of data, so that the noise can be circumvented. The choice of IHT can be justified by its robustness to noise. We will demonstrate this with further experiments on the supplementary material where we show that the baseline {CLEAN} approach resolves noise artefacts as actual sky sources.

We can refine our error bound for radio astronomy:

\begin{corollary}
Let $\sigma_n^2$ is the variance of noise introduced by a single antenna. By Theorem \ref{main_theorem_TH}, if $\hat{\gamma}_{2s}\leq 1/16$, the low precision iterative hard thresholding recovers the sky image ${\bf x}^s$ with accuracy
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[\|{\bf x}^{n+1} - {\bf x}^s \|_2] \leq 2^{-n}\| {\bf x}^s\|_2 + 10(\frac{\sqrt{L}}{\beta_{2s}}\sigma_n+\frac{L}{\hat{\beta}_{2s}}\epsilon_{\rm{sky}})
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_{\rm{sky}} =  \|{\bf x}^s \|_2/2^{b_{\bf \Phi}} + 1/2^{b_{\bf y}}$.
\label{corollary1}
\end{corollary}

%The above finding suggest that the sky image can be recovered with high accuracy when $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$ is sufficiently small. This will further be demonstrated in Section~\ref{section_experiments}.

%real life problems generally not known, whether the conditions are satisfied or not

{\bf Discussion: LOFAR and Beyond}
Corollary~\ref{corollary1} shows that the sky image 
can be recovered with high accuracy when certain conditions are hold:
${\beta}_{2s}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{2s}$ are sufficiently large, ${\gamma}_{2s}$ and $\hat{\gamma}_{2s}$
are sufficiently small. Do these conditions hold for a real telescope? We now analyze it for one station of the LOFAR telescope, and discuss it further for radio interferometers in general.

% Real-life problems usually lack of traditional RIP, that is, $\|{\bf \Phi}\|_2 < 1$. The scale-invariant feature of the measurement matrix used in normalized IHT however alleviates the RIP condition and imposes a fairly mild constraint in~\ref{rip_lowprecision}, i.e., non-symmetric RIP. In a series of paper~\cite{blumensath2010niht, blumensath2012greedy}, CoSaMP is shown to perform markedly worse when the RIP condition fails. IHT, however, still preserves its near-optimal recoveries far beyond the region of RIP. While this favors IHT over CoSaMP when applying to real-life problems, there is no rigid assumption imposed on $\ell_1$-minimization. Still \ref{rip} trivially holds.

% \label{fig:beta}
% \end{figure}
 Recall from Theorem~\ref{main_theorem_TH} the two conditions ensuring  performance guarantees: (a) $\gamma_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s} \leq 1/16$, (b) ${L}/{\hat{\beta}_{2s}}$ must be large to minimize quantization error $ {\epsilon}_q$. Fortunately, in the radio interferometry application, the image grid we initially form as well as scale-invariant property of normalized IHT yield us the control over $\gamma_{2s}, \hat{\gamma}_{2s}$ and ${\beta}_{2s}, \hat{\beta}_{2s}$, respectively, through a pre-processing of ${\bf \Phi}$. Analytic derivations of these parameters are possible in theory, but intractable due to amount of nonlinear operations contained in the formulation of ${\bf \Phi}$.

\label{fig:beta}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:beta}, for station CS302 of LOFAR, we first form the image grid and compute ${\bf \Phi}, \hat{\bf \Phi}$ such that $\alpha_{2s}, \hat{\alpha}_{2s}\leq 1/16$ holds, then numerically provide the scaling factors of errors $ {\epsilon}_s$ and ${\epsilon}_q$: $1/\beta_{2s}$ and ${L}/{\hat{\beta}_{2s}}$, respectively. Theorem~\ref{main_theorem_TH} states that the recovery error is induced by two terms: $\|{\bf e} \|_2/|\beta_{2s}$ and $L\|{\bf x}^s \|_2/{\hat{\beta}_{2s}$. Therefore we investigate these scaling over various antenna numbers and sparsity level. The results suggest that 2-bits IHT has a negligible quantization error when applied radio interferometry imaging problem.

\subsection{FPGA Implementation Details} \label{sec:fpga}
\vspace{-0.5em}

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are an alternative to commonly used Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for accelerated processing of compute intensive machine learning workloads. The custom logic fabric of an FPGA enables the design of specialized compute units, which is very advantageous when working on extremely low-precision and irregular numeric formats, such as 2-bit numbers. Thanks to the microarchitectural flexibility advantage, it is possible to achieve near linear speed-up when lowering the precision of data that is read from the memory. This has been shown recently for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when training linear models~\cite{zhang2017zipml, kara2017fpga}. In this work, we use the open-source FPGA implementation from the mentioned works and modify it to perform IHT.

In terms of the computation, we need to modify two parts of the design to convert it from performing SGD to IHT: 1) Instead of updating the model after a mini-batch count is reached, we update it after all samples are processed and the true gradient is available. 2) After each epoch, we perform a binary search on the updated model to find the threshold value satisfying that only top $S$ values are larger than the  threshold.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth, angle=0]{figs/niht_fpga.eps}
\caption{IHT on an FPGA-based system.}
\label{fig:fpga}
\end{figure}


{\bf Performance analysis:} The gradient computation unit as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fpga} reads the measurement matrix ${\bf \Phi}$ and the measurements ${\bf y}$ from main memory and keeps ${\bf x}$ in on-chip memory. It is able to process data from memory at ${\bf P}=12.8\,GB/s$. Thus, the design is bound on ${\bf P}$ for processing ${\bf \Phi}$ and ${\bf y}$. We achieve speed-up by quantizing ${\bf \Phi}$, because the time for each epoch is given by
$T = size({\bf \Phi})/{\bf P}$, since $size({\bf y}) \ll size({\bf \Phi})$. The essential idea behind achieving linear speed-up is keeping ${\bf P}$ constant as the precision of ${\bf \Phi}$ is lowered (${\bf P}\to \land \, size({\bf \Phi})\downarrow$), which leads to more values arriving within each transfer from main memory. ${\bf P}$ can be kept constant on an FPGA, because we can adapt the gradient computation unit's microarchitecture and increase its internal parallelism to handle more values per incoming line. 


{\bf Compute ${\bf \Phi}$ on the Fly:} The above analysis focuses on the case when ${\bf \Phi}$ 
is stored in main memory, in which case quantization helps to reduce the amount of 
data transferred between the main memory and FPGA. In some applications, ${\bf \Phi}$
can be calculated on the fly, inside the FPGA. Also in this case, quantization can help 
achieve better performance.
This is because the matrix-vector product between ${\bf \Phi}$ and ${\bf x}$ can be 
be performed with increased parallelism on an FPGA, if ${\bf \Phi}$ is quantized.
The reason why quantizing ${\bf \Phi}$ helps, even if it can be calculated on the fly, is
that a quantized ${\bf \Phi}$ saves many crucial resources (e.g., multipliers) that
are limited on an FPGA. These resource savings are very important in achieving a higher 
internal parallelism, for instance, to speed up the computation of ${\bf \Phi}\times{\bf x}$. 
For example, it has been shown by~\cite{kara2017fpga} that to go from 64-value dot product to 128-value
dot product on an FPGA, it is necessary to lower the precision of one side of the dot product to 2-bits.

\section{Experimental Results}\label{section_experiments}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We assess the empirical performance of our approach using the radio interferometer measurements from a real telescope: the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We first demonstrate that the accuracy achieved in the low precision setting is comparable with high precision IHT and other state-of-art methods; we then show the speed-up on FPGA.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Accuracy of Sky Recovery}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We recover the full sky image of the resolution $256\times 256$ pixels (${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^{65,536}$ in vectorized form) by employing 30 low-band antennas of LOFAR CS302 station that operates in 15-80 MHz frequency band where the sky is populated with 30 strong sources, that is, ${\bf y} \in \mathbb{C}^{900}$, $\hat{\bf \Phi} \in \mathbb{C}^{900\times 65,536}$. Signal-to-noise ratio is 0 dB at the antenna level, i.e., $10\log_{10}(\|{\bf \Phi x}\|_2^2/\|{\bf e}\|_2^2) = 0$ dB. 

\vspace{-0.5em}
{\bf Improving least square estimates}
Fig.~\ref{fig:sky_images} provides an example of sky recoveries: (a) ground truth estimated over 12 hours of observation, (b) a least square estimate of underlying sky (or dirty image in the nomenclature of radio astronomy), (c) 32/32-bits and (d) 2/8-bits (normalized) IHT. This experiment indicates that low precision IHT captures the sky sources successively even when only 2-bits are used to compress ${\bf \Phi}$. This suggests that we can drastically reduce the data precision yet still estimate the sky precisely.

This strong empirical performance is not completely surprising. Mathematically, the measurement matrix we formed here reflects the phase relations, as induced by the antenna locations.  That is, each time a bit $r_{m, n}$ or $c_{m, n}$ flips its sign where $\hat{\bf \Phi}_{m, n} = r_{m, n} +j c_{m,n}$, $m = {1, 2, ..., M}$ and $n = {1, 2, ..., N}$, we approximately know the change in horizontal and vertical directions on the ground, preserving the phase information required for interferometric imaging even at very low precision.

%Recall from the former discussions that noise in receivers is far stronger than the weak incoming signals thus low SNR at the antenna level results, i.e., usually ranged from -5 to 5 dB. The CLEAN algorithm notably underperforms in the presence of significant noise. This undesirable property is yet not surprising. A careful look into the the algorithmic steps, it apparently matches also to the noise artefacts in the image considering them as a point source. This can also be justified mathematically: we designed the problem such that an execution of {CLEAN} corresponds to the first iteration recovery of IHT, which interprets our numerical results. 

%The reader might argue that, besides being on its most possible realistic setting, the above experiment does not fully capture the performance of low precision iht especially when only 2-bits are used to represent a dense measurement matrix.

{\bf Comparison to state-of-art methods}
We compare low precision IHT to high precision IHT, CoSaMP and an $\ell_1$-based approach in terms of their capability to recover sparse signals. For this particular formulation of the interferometric imaging problem, they can iteratively build up an estimate of sky map ${\bf x}$. In order to avoid creating bias towards any algorithm, we optimized each algorithm independently.

\label{fig:comparison}
\end{figure}
We evaluate the algorithms through two different metrics: (1) the recovery error and (2) exact support recovery. In radio interferometry, however, it is customary to use number of true celestial sources resolved in the recovered image as a performance metric, i.e., true-positive findings. That is, the performance of the algorithms is no longer described by its ability to recover support entirely but the sky objects, which possess higher error tolerance. 
We demonstrate in Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison}{(b)} that IHT performs as good as its alternatives and compatible to $\ell_1$-minimization in terms of its exact recovery performance. The empirical results suggest that the celestial sources can still be recovered by dramatically compressing ${\bf \Phi}$.

{\bf Discussion:} This experiment is informative merely on the accuracy of the results obtained implementing these alternative algorithms. A fair comparison involves the analysis of different properties such as speed and storage requirements, flexibility and ease of implementation. In brief, 
%CoSaMP has strong theoretical guarantee when the least squares solution is supplied and requires the solution to an inverse problem at each iteration, which is costly in general and demands better storage capability~\cite{needel2008cosamp}. On the other hand, 
IHT is shown to outperform CoSaMP when ${\bf \Phi}$ has similar entries in magnitude, e.g., radio interferometer case and has significant speed advantage~\cite{blumensath2012greedy}. Empirical evidence further suggests that IHT performs nearly as well as the $\ell_1$-based approach. %Referring back to supplemetary material, the CLEAN requires a 2D Fourier inversion and deconvolution per iteration thus the operational expense of the method is relatively higher compared to those of IHT and CoSaMP~\cite{simeoni2015rai}. 
The low precision approach has similar performance guarantees with high precision IHT. This is evident in Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison}.

\subsection{Speed-up on FPGA}
\vspace{-0.5em}

We demonstrate the speed up for performing IHT on the FPGA-based system in Fig.~\ref{fig:fpga_time}. For the time spent for each iteration, we observe that quantization, and the resulting compression of the measurement matrix ${\bf \Phi}$ leads to near linear speed up for recovering the support vector. As previously studied in the performance analysis part in Section~\ref{sec:fpga}, all variants (full precision to lowest precision) of IHT on FPGA can consume ${\bf \Phi}$ at the same rate, and therefore the runtime of IHT is linearly dependent on the size of ${\bf \Phi}$, thereby leading to linear speed ups that we observe in the experiments.

In terms of end-to-end performance, we measure the time for
each precision level needs to reach support recovery
ratio 90\% and calculate the end-to-end speedup. We see 
that 2/8-bit IHT reaches the same support recovery
ratio 9.14$\times$ faster.



%A subtle observation related to the particular system's characteristics: When comparing the runtime between 32-bit floating-point precision and 2-bit precision, we observe 7.7x speed up, although the data compression rate is 8x. The reason for that is, when using quantized ${\bf \Phi}$, the FPGA reads for each epoch a freshly quantized ${\bf \Phi}$ (due to stochastic quantization) and therefore reads from a different location in main memory; whereas when using full-precision ${\bf \Phi}$, the FPGA always reads from the same location in main memory, utilizing the cache more efficiently. This is the reason, why the speed up rate is not perfectly matching the compression rate.

\section{Discussion}\label{section_discussion}

We investigated the applicability of low precision schemes to sparse signal recovery problems, and introduced a low-precision NIHT variant, with theoretical guarantees and good practical performance, both in terms of accuracy and recovery time. 
An application to radio astronomy validated our claim and showed that the heuristic and rigorous arguments are in agreement with experiments. The results bear out that our approach offers similar accuracy with the high precision IHT even with far less precision of data points. Further, we showed that even using 2-bits to represent data hence significant speed-up on hardware, accuracy of sparse approximations can still be preserved.

There are several questions for future work. In particular, can we devise algorithms which work with end-to-end low precision data representation? Can we extend these techniques to other greedy recovery algorithms, and other sparse recovery frameworks?
